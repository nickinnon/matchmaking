# Matchmaking

This is a demonstration on how to build microservices leveraging docker. Each dir from root is a stand alone application. All applications can be run together via docker-compose.

## Quick Start

1) Run docker-compose.yml to configure Postgres, Redis, /Api, /Matchmaker
2) In VSCode, `cmd shift p` -> `open folder in container...` select the microservice from the dialog and begin development.
3) See the microservice README for app specific instructions.


## Prerequisites
- Docker
